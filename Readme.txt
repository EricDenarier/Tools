 GaussianFitTool is a tool that gives the FWMH of all lines presnt in the ROI manager 
 
 KymoTools is a set of Tool to draw and analyze Kymograph :
 SplitVertical : Is used to split Dualview images in 2. Option can be used to cut horizontally and in several parts
 Filter : DoG settings to ameliorate small particles (linear or spots) Option can be used to change the size of filters and change Median to Gaussian Blur for the small size filters
 Kymo : This tool is used to create Kymograph from TimeLapse stack the width of the line can be set (linewidth) and it reports the maximal value across the line width for the entire TimeLapse stack and create a x/t image.
Slope&Speed : This macro calculate the speed of Polymerization and Depol from the tracks of several kymograph saved in the ROI manager. The real speed is calculated if the unit of the kymograph are correctly set
